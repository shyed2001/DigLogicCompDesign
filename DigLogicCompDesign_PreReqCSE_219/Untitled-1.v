// The Verilog code for the above circuit
// Pease give the correct and complete verilog code
// Have to find out the addresses for both RAM and ROM.
// 1. A NOT gate has an inpot , input pin number A16, which hs a output ocnnected to the second pin of a three input NAND gate.
// 2. The NAND gate has three inputs, input pin number A15, A16  and A19, which has a output and it is  connected to the input pin of a NOT gate and this NOT gate output is connected to a 3 to 8 decoder E1 pin.
// 3. The 3 to 8 decoder has three inputs, input pin number A12, A13 and A14, which O5 and O2 wires connected to RAM and ROM Respectively. 
// Wire O2 of 3 to 8 decoder is connected to the CS pin of a 4kx8 ROM via/ after being connected to two  NOT gates in series. The 3 to 8 decoder has 0V and +5V power supply pins.
// The 4kx8 ROM has 12 address lines, A0 to A11, and CS, RW and WR pins.
// 4. The 3 to 8 decoder has another connection, after being connected to two  NOT gates in series O5 connects to CS of a 2kx8 RAM, this connection has two not gates in serise.
// The 2kx8 RAM has 11 address lines, A0 to A10, and CS, RW pins.


// The Verilog code for the above circuit
// Pease give the correct and complete verilog code
// Have to find out the addresses for both RAM and ROM.
